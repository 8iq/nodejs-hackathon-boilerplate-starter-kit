# Rapid Development Node.js Hackathon template 

This template based on [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone) and [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).

We also use [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) for React based mobile app development.
[Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) as React Web UI kit and [UI Kitten](https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten) as React Native UI kit 

KeystoneJS is just a glue between [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), 
[ApolloGraphql](https://github.com/apollographql/), Mongoose/Knex/Prisma (as ORM).

Next.js is just a zero config React based framework.
